# Axiom box: `pry0cc/lazy`
Welcome to the second publicly available axiom box on github!

## Description
This box is a fork of https://github.com/victoni/Bug-Bounty-Scripts/, this is a repo of Vict0ni's bug bounty emumeration scripts and some tooling that he uses, I thought it was a perfect example for what this does.

## Whats in the box
- lazy.sh - enumeration script
- wgetlines - wget for while read loop utility
- custom ZSH theme
- Some extra useful zsh aliases

# Installation
```
axiom-boxes get pry0cc/lazy
```

# Usage
```
axiom-init --restore=pry0cc/lazy
```

```
axiom-select my-server
axiom-restore pry0cc/lazy
```

Enjoy!
